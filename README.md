# widgets

I will use this project to create widgets to my own flutter proyects.

All widgets will use only code (widgets, class and methods) included in the same file
because in that way is easier to implement on flutterflow

I am programming with flutter, the other programming languages are automatically created by flutter.
So I didn't write a single line with another language in this project.
